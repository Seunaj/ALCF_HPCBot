We have an objective to develop a robust RAG system for ALCF user support. Our methods are to:

    1. generate human-like question-answer (QA) pairs from ALCF user guides.
    2. augment the dataset with QA pairs collected from support tickets.
    3. evaluate the difficulty of the questions to:
        a. facilitate the performance comparison of LLMs.
        b. faciliate the developmetn of the agentic RAG system for ALCF user support.
